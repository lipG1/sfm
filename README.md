# sfm
my process of learning sfm
the 2_stage sfm is a easy demo of sfm;as the usual process show,it includes extract features and match them,then get the E and get theR and T ,fianlly update these params. 
the BA function  like the process in opencv/stitching/motion_estimator ,which is very useful for many problems!
